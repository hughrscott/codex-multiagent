# ADR-0001: Initial architecture
## Context
We are using a local MCP server to expose repo tools, and a LangGraph multi-agent workflow (PM, BA, SWE, QA).

## Decision
Use PR-first flow with CI gates; restrict writes to src/tests/docs; expose fs/git/tests/github tools.

## Consequences
Safer, auditable automation that can work on existing repos.
